# A little about me...

Hey there! My name is Roark Chao, and I'm a second year Electrical Engineering student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I specialize in integrated circuits, microwaves, and photonics. 

In my freetime, I enjoy cooking, driving, gaming, and taking care of animals.

Currently, I live with three other students but I intend to shift into a single living environment after I adopt a pet dog come the end of my third year.
